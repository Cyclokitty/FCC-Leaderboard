Free Code Camp React Project #2
===============================

FCC Camper Leaderboard
======================

* I can see a table of the Free Code Camp campers who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.

* I can see how many brownie points they have earned in the last 30 days, and how many they've earned in total.

* I can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and by how many brownie points they've earned in total.

* I used Sass and React for this Project
